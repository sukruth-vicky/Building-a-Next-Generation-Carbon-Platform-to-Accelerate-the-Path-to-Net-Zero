Achieving net-zero targets requires organizations to measure, manage, and reduce carbon emissions with far greater precision than traditional tools allow. 
In this case, a global organization partnered with McKinsey & Company to build a next-generation carbon platform that enables scalable, data-driven decarbonization across operations and value chains.

Many organizations struggle with fragmented emissions data, manual reporting processes, and limited visibility into Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. 
Existing tools often lack the flexibility to support real-time decision-making or scenario modeling, making it difficult to translate sustainability ambitions into actionable plans.

McKinsey supported the design and development of a digital carbon platform that integrates data from multiple sources, automates emissions calculations, and provides a single source of truth for carbon performance. 
The platform enables organizations to track emissions at a granular level, model reduction pathways, and prioritize the most impactful decarbonization levers.

Advanced analytics and scenario modeling capabilities allow users to simulate the impact of operational changes, technology investments, and supplier actions. 
This enables leadership teams to compare pathways, balance cost and impact, and sequence initiatives effectively.

Pilot implementations demonstrated clear benefits. Organizations using the platform improved emissions transparency, reduced manual reporting effort, and accelerated decision-making. 
The platform also enabled faster identification of high-impact abatement opportunities across assets and value chains.

This case illustrates how digital platforms can transform sustainability from a reporting exercise into a strategic, operational capability that accelerates progress toward net zero.
